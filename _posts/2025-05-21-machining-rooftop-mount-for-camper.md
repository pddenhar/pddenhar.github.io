title: Machining Roof Bar Mounts for my Ambulance

I wanted a way to mount my canoe on my ambulance camper and I already had a pair of Yakima round bars but no 
way to mount them to the existing hard points on the roof. I whipped up a clamp that could mount the bars to 
the roof in Fusion and machined it on my Tormach PCNC440.

A trick I like doing for flat parts is skipping a second setup and saving stock by just machining the first op on the end face of a big piece of bar stock:

Afterwards I throw it in my AF50 bandsaw and slice the part off from the bar stock like a piece of bread. 
The AF50 makes such straight cuts that the part comes out almost perfectly flat and the stock is ready right away to make another part.

I also used the AF50 to make a relief cut into the part so that it could clamp onto my Yakima roof bars:
