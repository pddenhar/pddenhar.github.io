	<h3>About Me?</h3>
	<p>I am Peter Den Hartog. I'm currently working towards a degree in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science at
	 the University of Wisconsin, Madison. I build things, program in assembly, and work administering websites. This is my blog / portfolio / scratchpad. Perhaps I will post some things about myself
	 on here, I might even use some buzzwords. New-generation. Dynamic focus. Turn-key solutions.
	 <br><br>
	 Perfect.
