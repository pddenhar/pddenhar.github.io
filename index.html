		<h2>Creating timelapses with ffmpeg</h2>
		<div id="date">01/06/12</div>
		<p>I recently ran into a project where I wanted to take a folder full of JPEG images and turn them into a timelapse. I found a few snippets of script on the web, but nothing that did exactly what I wanted. To remedy that, I wrote a script that takes all the images in your present working directory and uses ffmpeg to create a timelapse out of them: <a href="/downloads/make_movie.sh">Download</a></p>

		<h2>Creating an N64 Controller Adapter with Arduino</h2>
		<div id="date">05/24/12</div>
		<p>One of my older but consistently popular articles is my guide to communicating with an N64 controller via an Arduino. You can find the full guide <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Use-an-Arduino-with-an-N64-controller/">here</a>.</p>

	<h3>About Me?</h3>
	<p>I am Peter Den Hartog. I'm currently working towards a degree in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science at
	 the University of Wisconsin, Madison. I build things, program in assembly, and work administering websites. This is my blog / portfolio / scratchpad. Perhaps I will post some things about myself
	 on here, I might even use some buzzwords. New-generation. Dynamic focus. Turn-key solutions.
	 <br><br>
	 Perfect.
