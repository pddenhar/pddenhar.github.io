title: Replacing Individual Cells in a Gen 2 Prius Battery
custom_css: syntax.css
---
I purchased a 2006 XW20 Prius (Gen 2) from a trucking company that had used it as a shuttle vehicle. 
The red triangle warning light was on with codes for a bad hybrid battery. To save money, I decided to try 
repairing the battery using individual cells purchased from Ebay instead of immediately paying for a whole refurbished pack.

[ChrisFix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3RCdrh666w) has an excellent video on YouTube detailing the removal of the hybrid battery. I followed that step by step
(seriously, buy the [trim tool](https://amzn.to/2GP5lpl) and some replacement [trim clips](https://amzn.to/2GWj7b2) from Amazon! It makes the job so much easier) to remove the rear interior, seats, and hybrid battery. 

I also purchased some [Toyota WS ATF](https://amzn.to/2LqJzxw) while I was at it, figuring that I might as well refresh the transaxle fluid while I was working on the hybrid system.

Once I had the battery out of the car and on my bench I measured the voltage of each of the 28 cell packs. All of them except for cell 11 and cell 21 were within a few hundredths of a volt of 7.75v. Cells 11 and 21 were both close to 6.45v.
