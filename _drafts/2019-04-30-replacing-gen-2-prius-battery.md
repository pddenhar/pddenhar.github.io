title: Replacing Individual Cells in a Gen 2 Prius Battery
custom_css: syntax.css
---
I purchased a 2006 XW20 Prius (Gen 2) from a trucking company that had used it as a shuttle vehicle. 
The red triangle warning light was on with codes for a bad hybrid battery. To save money, I decided to try 
repairing the battery using individual cells purchased from Ebay instead of immediately paying for a wholre refurbished pack. 

[ChrisFix]() has an excellent video on YouTube detailing the removal of the hybrid battery. I followed that step by step
(seriously, buy the trim tool from Amazon! It makes the job so much easier) to remove the rear interior, seats, and hybrid battery.
